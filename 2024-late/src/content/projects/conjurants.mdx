        #### Gameplay Loop
        I took inspiration from Clash Royale and Teamfight Tactics. On a 14x20 grid, two opponents spawn units on opposite ends. The units march forward and battle. Each player has a Blood Forger that they must keep alive, or they will lose. Blood Forgers march forward periodically until they meet in the middle and fight until only one is left alive.

        #### Setting & Story
        The sophisticated crafts of magic have been forgotten by most. What little knowledge left is practiced by Blood Forgers who fuel the war of Tepra by conjuring relentless armies. Anadeln, a nation bordering the Abyssal Rift, must unite the thrones of Tepra to fight back against the invading forces of Venelit.

        #### Godot Over Unreal
        I chose Godot Engine over my usual choice (Unreal Engine) for this project. I needed quick iteration cycles, fast compilation, and proper Git workflow. So far, I am very happy with my choice!

        #### Godot Is Weird
        In Unreal, an Actor has its logic directly attached to it. In Unity, game objects can have multiple scripts attached to them. In Godot, however, you must composition nodes with a script attached to each.

        #### C# in Godot
        Over the years, I've become familiar with C++ and C#. I decided to use C# as my main language for Conjurants, as it is easy to write, type-safe, and quick to compile.

    <div slot="right-col">
        #### Rust Bindings
        Expensive calculations benefit from high performance languages. For performance and compile-time safety, I used GDExtension to bind my Rust library.

    <div slot="left-col">
        #### Gameplay Framework
        Godot gives you freedom to shape your game how you want to. There is no "gameplay framework" (like Unreal's) that provides a base to your game. So I decided to create a plugin very similar to Unreal's Gameplay Framework - this plugin handles player controllers, switching between levels, game modes, posessing avatars, etc.

        #### Flowfield Pathfinding
        The 14x20 grid has no obstacles. This means in most cases I will not need any kind of pathfinding, as the units will need to walk in a straight line to reach their target. I use a flowfield to direct the units towards the enemy Blood Forger. And because the Blood Forger is a 2x2 unit, sometimes pathfinding is needed to go around it to reach a target.
