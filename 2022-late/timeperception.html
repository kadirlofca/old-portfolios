                <h1>TIME PERCEPTION</h1>
                <p>
                    Just like how we feel time passing quicker when we're gaming or watching a movie, we also feel time passing quicker in VR. "Why does this happen?" is a
                    big question, so I focused on a smaller one; "Does physicality in VR affect time perception?"

                        <p>
                            After finishing the Magnolia House, my professor invited me to continue working with him on this project.
                            This project started at NextGen Interactions as a solution to hazardous material (hazmat)
                            training. We worked together with the NextGen Interactions team researching if training in VR would produce any undesirable effects, such as the time perception issue.
                        </p>

                    <h3>PHYSICALITY</h3>
                    <p>The physicality of a VR experience relates to the haptic feedback given to the user. In standard VR experiences, the only haptic feedback comes from the controllers in the form of vibrations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Passive haptics is the feedback generated from contact with surfaces. When you're touching a wall, you receive feedback as passive haptics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="infocards">
                    <div>
                        <h3>DESIGN</h3>
                        <p>I designed a VR experience to collect data about the users' time perception with standard VR equipment, and their time perception in a high-physicality VR setting that uses passive haptics.</p>
                        <p>
                            The experience incorporates elements from a hazmat training session. The setting is an office where a hazardous gas is reported to be coming through a vent. The user must navigate the scene in VR
                            and make their way to the vent. Then, they must hold a device onto the vent to measure the properties of the hazardous gas.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <img src="assets/images/timeperception_vents.jpg" style="width: 400px">
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>The data collection happens when the user is at the vent. The device makes a sound once it reaches the vent, and another sound once it completes the scan.
                        The user must count between these two sounds and tell me their estimation of the time that has passed between the sounds. The system I programmed records 
                        the actual time that has passed between the two sounds, so I can compare it with the user's estimation later. In order to increase the number of data points,
                        the user must repeat the process for all 5 vents in the office.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>The user repeats the experience 3 times, each time with a different level of physicality:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real World: Participant completes the task in the real world under no VR influence.</li>
                        <li>Low Physicality: Participant completes the task under standard VR influence (a headset and 2 controllers.)</li>
                        <li>High Physicality: The participant does not use controllers. Instead, their hands are tracked and they are able to touch objects (passive haptics) they see through the headset.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                        <h3>SIMULATING THE ROOM</h3>
                        <p>In order to achieve the high-physicality level, I created a virtual environment that perfectly simulates the room we used to conduct the experiment.
                            Because everything in the room is modeled and visible in the virtual environment, the user can just touch and feel the objects as if they weren't in VR.
                        </p>
                        <p>But how is the user able to see their hands? I used a Leap Motion device to track the user's hands and display them in VR. Their hands are displayed as 
                            if they are wearing gloves, I did this so that unmatching skin colors don't take them out of the experience.
                        </p>

                <div>
                    <p>NextGen Interactions provided a door that can stand by itself. I attached a Vive tracker to the corner of the door to track and display it in the virtual scene.
                        This way, the user is able to open and close the door in VR. NextGen Interactions also provided a 3D printed model of the scanning device. I attached another Vive tracker
                        to it and displayed it in VR.
                    </p>

                        <h3>MODELING & TEXTURING</h3>
                        <p>I used Blender to model and UV map the room. To achieve accurate scale, I took measurements of every wall with a tape measure and entered the values into Blender to have a perfect match. I also modeled the door and desks using the same method.</p>
                        <p>I used Affinity Designer to manually draw the floor texture, but I photoscanned some parts of the room (like the door) because they had more complicated textures. I mapped the scanned photo onto the door.</p>

                        <h3>CONVERTING POSITION TO ROTATION</h3>
                        <p>Due to how I had the door set up, I was only able to utilize the positional data from the Vive tracker, and not the rotational data.
                            I calculated the direction from the Vive tracker to the door hinge and converted it to a quaternion. I then set the rotation of the door
                            to that quaternion. This way, the virtual door rotates to match the position of the tracker.

                        <h3>AUTOMATING THE PROCESS</h3>
                        <p>
                            At first, I would manually transfer collected data to an excel sheet. This quickly became cumbersome as I was dealing with hundreds of data points.
                            I programmed a <a href="https://github.com/kadirlofca/unity-csvmaker" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tool for Unity</a> to automate the process of writing collected data into a sheet. As data is collected, a Vector2 position and the value
                            is passed into an instance of the tool, the tool then writes the given value into the given position. Exporting the sheet as a .csv can be requested at any point during the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After finishing the data collection phase, I utilized libraries such as tidyverse and rstatix in R and RStudio to analyze the data.

                        <p>
                            After collecting 480 data points, we found no significant change between low and high physicality time perception. 
                            Here are some things I did along the way:

                    I worked on this project for 
                    over a year, and I learned a lot. Not only programming, but management, research, connecting with people. I finished this project as a new person, and I'm grateful
