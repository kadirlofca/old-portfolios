                <h1>MAGNOLIA HOUSE</h1>
                <p>
                    The Magnolia House provided a place to stay for black Americans during segregation. Today, it stands as an
                    artifact of the past with visitors coming to see the lives of those who stayed there.

                    <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
                    <p>Magnolia House was my first professional experience. The job posting stated that the position was for graduate
                        students only, so I wasn't going to apply. My cousin encouraged me, telling me my skills were perfect for the job.
                        I applied and got the job!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked with my professor and a client to create this VR tour for people to see
                        the Magnolia House in the 1950's. Now, the tour is experienced and praised by visitors of the house.

                        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the user puts on the headset, they find themselves in the corridor of the house. A black stripe surrounding them leads their
                            eye towards the tutorial panel. From this panel, they learn how to teleport around the house. They push the controller stick to
                            target the teleportation ray, as they do that, the tutorial panel disappears and leaves the user to explore the house. The user targets
                            the ray, releases the stick, and teleports.
                        </p>

                        <h3>NAVIGATION</h3>
                        <p>
                            The user is able to explore both floors of the house by teleporting. I implemented a navmesh that appears when the user is targeting
                            the teleportation ray. I modeled the navmesh in Blender, I had full control over where the user could explore. Because of this, I was able to leave
                            some rooms empty and focus on making the explorable rooms look and feel better.

                        <h3>LIGHTING & REFLECTIONS</h3>
                        <p>
                            I used Unity's lighting and reflection tools to create believable lighting. I positioned lights outside the house next to the windows to simulate
                            sunlight coming in. The sunlight from the windows are assisted with a little ambient lighting too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The glasses and mirrors utilize the reflection probes I positioned inside each room.
                        </p>

                        <h3>SHADERS & MATERIALS</h3>
                        <p>
                            I created the materials and shaders myself using the shader graph tool. 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Some materials have a noise texture to create imperfections on surfaces to increase believability.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Some materials have reflections that bounce light from the reflection probes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I created a diverse set of materials. Materials are opaque, transparent, reflective/non-reflective, emissive/non-emissive.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>OCCLUSION CULLING & MODEL OPTIMIZATION</h3>
                        <p>
                            The amount of lights and reflection probes I used was very taxing on the Meta Quest 2. The framerate was below the 90hz refresh
                            rate the display was capable of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I optimized the performance by utilizing frustum and occlusion culling inside Unity. But that wasn't enough. The model which was provided
                            by my team wasn't optimized for a game engine. I used Blender to delete vertices that weren't going to be seen by the user.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We finished the project and launched it on the clients Meta Quest 2 headsets. The visitors of the house responded positively. I learned a lot
                            about optimization and VR development. 4 months spent well!
