                <h1>WHY DO I DO WHAT I DO? </h1>
                <br>
                <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
                <p>
                    Spiderman 2 (2004) on my father's computer got me into gaming. I loved 
                    everything about this game, but I never managed to beat it as a kid. Later in life, I found the same game disc and finally beat the game.
                    This was around the time Lego Star Wars came out. As a Lego aficionado who spent his childhood obsessed with Lego, I got my hands on the game and played it over
                    and over again on my Playstation 2. I started playing mostly Lego games, and didn't even bother trying other ones. That was until
                    one incredible game came out...
                    <br><br>
                    Minecraft was the perfect game for someone who played Lego all their life; a game with endless creative freedom. I quickly fell in love
                    with the game and played it for years. I built amazing worlds and made great friendships. One day, one of my Minecraft friends invited me
                    to play another game, Team Fortress 2. This is where I experienced a video game revolution. I got introduced to Steam as I was trying to figure out where to download
                    Team Fortress 2 from. Hundreds of incredible games, right in front of me... 
                    <br><br>
                    As I discovered and played different genres from Steam, a desire to make my own game grew inside me.             
                </p>

                <h3>WORK</h3>
                <p>
                    My first attempt at making a game was by downloading a 2D game engine. My dreams were quickly shattered not only because the engine was complicated and confusing, but also because
                    I had no idea what programming was. I remember vividly how lost I was trying to grasp the concept of a scene/level. I stopped trying and started looking elsewhere to make my game.
                    <br><br> 
                    I came across a website called Sploder. This website let you drag and drop game elements to make your own Flash game. I instantly made an <a href="https://www.sploder.com/games/members/walker136/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" target="_blank">account</a> 
                    and made a game. Although I was happy and proud of my progress, Sploder wasn't enough for my ambitious plans. I needed more freedom to make my specific games. So I continued my
                    journey to figure out how to make games.
                    <br><br>
                    This is where I meet Unity. I was super excited to learn Unity, I started trying out different features from the UI, and I pretty much figured out nothing. The problem was, once again, 
                    programming. I had no clue what programming was and how it worked. So I uninstalled Unity. I was frustrated, so many ideas with no way of bringing them to life. I let go and forgot
                    about game development...
                    <br><br>
                    Although I stopped trying to make games, I kept playing them and I still had an itch to make games. One day I decided to learn coding. I followed a YouTube tutorial to make a calculator 
                    in Python. I successfully made the calculator. I was starting to understand how code worked, and I found it fascinating. Like Lego, like Minecraft, coding was a tool for me to create
                    awesome stuff.
                    <br><br>
                    I grew confident in coding and decided to try out Unity again. I mistakenly downloaded Unreal Engine 4 instead. I did not realize my mistake at the time, because all game engines looked
                    the same to me.
